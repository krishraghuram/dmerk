# Readme

dmerk (pronounced dee-merk) is a program that creates a [merkle tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree) for your directories.

This can be useful in many situations. For example, to detect which file was modified, or to compare two backups for duplicate files.
Think hash digest / checksum verification, but instead of comparing just a pair of hash digests, we are comparing two trees of digests.

## Installation

```
pip install dmerk
```

## Usage / Quickstart

Note: All `dmerk` subcommands save merkle trees to json files by default. This behavior can be modified using the `-n, --no-save` flag, but it's not recommended, since constructing merkle trees is expensive (esp. for large directories), so saving can help protect against accidental loss of the output (eg: in cases where terminal gets reset/closed accidentally).

#### generate

To generate a merkle tree for a directory:
```
dmerk generate /path/to/directory
```

By default, the output is saved as a json file in the current directory.
This behavior can be modified using the `-n, --no-save` and `-p, --print` flags.
Custom filename can be specified using `-f FILENAME, --filename FILENAME` option.

#### compare

To compare two merkle trees,
```
dmerk compare <path1> <path2>
```

The paths path1 and path2 can be paths to directories, or they can be path to json files created using generate.
If these are paths to directories, the generated merkle trees are saved to files, in the same way as-if generate command was invoked.
This behavior can be modified using the `-n, --no-save` option.

#### analyse

NotImplementedError üòÇ

## Features and Limitations

* Currently tested only for Linux, support for Windows and OSX coming soon‚Ñ¢.
* The program requires read permission on files, and read and execute permissions on directories. Missing permission would throw an exception.
* Will only handle normal files, directories and symlinks (to normal files and directories).
	- Presence of "special" files like char/block devices, sockets, pipes, or symlinks (to "special" files) will throw an exception.
* Will handle hidden files and directories.
* Will only work for file and directory names that are valid utf-8 byte sequences.
	- If you'd like support for non-utf-8 file/directory names, kindly +1 [this issue](https://github.com/krishraghuram/dmerk/issues/2).
* Currently, the digest algorithm used is md5, because it's fast. CLI option for this coming soon‚Ñ¢.
* Currently, directory digest only depends on it's file contents, and is independent of the file names and file metadata (permissions, owner, group, atime, mtime, ctime etc).
	- If you have a need for directory digest that depends on metadata, please open a new issue explaining the use-case.

## Development

If you want to report bugs/issues, or need help troubleshooting, or have an idea for a new feature/improvement,
kindly file and issue in github, and I'll take a look as soon as I can.
Thank you for showing interest in this software üòÅ.
